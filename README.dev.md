# Dev details

We want to have a documentation page for both V1 and V2.
To achieve this, demo is made to work with the aricall-everywhere from the npm registry.
And V2 is made to work with the local version of the library.

## Publish the docs

Building the V1 is as before.
Building the V2 is done with additional webpack configs.

That build the V2 and copies in the V1 folder under V2.

## Development

There are two different scripts to run one or the other.

## Build

The script was not modified, because we always build the latest version of the library.
